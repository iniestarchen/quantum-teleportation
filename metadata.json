  "long_description": "Quantum teleportation transfers the full quantum state of a qubit from one location to another using a pre-shared entangled Bell pair and two classical bits of communication. The original qubit is destroyed in the process (no-cloning). In this circuit q[0] holds the state |+\u27e9 to be teleported, q[1] is Alice's half of the Bell pair, and q[2] is Bob's half. After Alice's Bell measurement and Bob's corrections, q[2] ends up in |+\u27e9.",
